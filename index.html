            <b>Hi!</b> My name is Markus, I'm 25 years old and live in Copenhagen. I'm originally
            from Espergærde in Nordsjælland but moved to the big city with my brother a couple of
            months ago so I could be closer to my friends, my study, and my potential internship.
            Right now I'm studying Multi Media Design at KEA (Københavns Erhversakademi) and I'm
            looking for a challenging but fun internship! My main focus is Front End development and
            webdesign, but I have been taught in (almost) every aspect of communication and design
            so far. Some of my Front End skills are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS and REACT and I'm
            looking forward to be expanding this list!
          </p>
          <p>
            My personality is a weird mix of introvert and extrovert - I love meeting and talking to
            new and interesting people that I can learn from and be inspired by, but I also value
            being alone and getting to dive deep down in to my work or hobbies. One of my hobbies is
            photography and you can follow me
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hoffmannlund/">here</a> on Instagram to see some of
            my pictures. I'm always mixing between digital and analogue photography, but my latest
            experiment has been to capture and edit only using my phone - as Chase Jarvis said;
            <i>"the best camera is the one that's with you".</i> Some of my favourite places to take
            pictures has been in Asia and I've been to Japan and South Korea multiple times. I'm
            deeply fascinated by asian culture and feel very inspired by everything they do. I'm
            both a coffee and tea drinker, and can always go for a "fyraftensøl" - so feel free to
            contact me if you want to know more!
